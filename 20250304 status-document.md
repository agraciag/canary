# NeMo Canary Project Status - March 4, 2025

## Current Status
The NeMo Canary project has been set up with a working Docker container environment that provides access to NVIDIA's Canary-1B model for speech recognition and translation.

## Implemented Features
- Docker container configured with NeMo and GPU access
- Basic command-line transcription functionality
- Web-based real-time transcription interface
- Support for 4 languages (English, German, Spanish, French)
- Both ASR and translation capabilities

## Technical Components
1. **Docker Environment**
   - Container based on nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.12.01
   - GPU passthrough configured
   - Volume mounting for code and data persistence

2. **Core Applications**
   - Command-line interface (improved-rtc.py)
   - Web interface (streaming-rtc.py + templates/index.html)
   - Audio capture and processing pipeline

3. **Pending Dependencies**
   - Sound-related packages need installation (sounddevice, soundfile)
   - PortAudio system dependencies required

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Install missing dependencies in container:
     ```
     pip install sounddevice soundfile flask flask-socketio
     apt-get update && apt-get install -y libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev
     ```
   - Test audio capture with microphone

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add audio visualization
   - Implement translation memory
   - Add support for file upload and batch processing
   - Improve error handling and recovery

## Usage Instructions
- Command-line: `python /workspace/src/improved-rtc.py --task asr --source-lang en`
- Web interface: `python /workspace/src/streaming-rtc.py` (access via browser at http://localhost:5000)

## Issues and Limitations
- Dependencies not fully installed in container
- May need to configure host audio device passthrough to container
- Transcription accuracy depends on audio quality and language
