# NeMo Canary Project Summary

## Project Overview
We've set up a working environment for NVIDIA's NeMo Canary-1B model, which provides state-of-the-art speech recognition and translation capabilities. This model supports automatic speech recognition (ASR) in English, German, Spanish, and French, as well as translation between these languages.

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - Created and configured a Docker container using NVIDIA's NeMo image
   - Successfully connected the container to GPU resources
   - Set up volume mounting for data persistence

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Loaded and tested the Canary-1B model
   - Created scripts for transcription and translation
   - Implemented batch processing capabilities for multiple files
   - Set up output management for saving transcripts

3. **Working Scripts**
   - `test_canary.py`: Basic model test with sample audio
   - `simple_transcribe.py`: Single file transcription/translation
   - `batch_process.py`: Process entire directories of audio files

## Supported Features

- **Languages**: English (en), German (de), Spanish (es), French (fr)
- **Tasks**: 
  - ASR (transcription)
  - Speech translation (source language to target language)
- **Formats**: All output saved as text files in `/workspace/transcripts`

## Next Steps and Possibilities

1. **User Interface**
   - Web interface for easier interaction with the model
   - Integration with existing applications

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time transcription with microphone input
   - Speaker diarization (who said what)
   - Custom vocabulary adaptation

3. **Production Deployment**
   - API development for programmatic access
   - Performance optimization for faster processing
   - Fine-tuning for specific domains or accents

4. **Data Processing Pipelines**
   - Integration with YouTube, podcast platforms
   - Automated transcription workflows
   - Transcript post-processing (formatting, summarization)

The project now has a solid foundation to build upon, with the core NeMo Canary functionality working correctly through the Docker container.
